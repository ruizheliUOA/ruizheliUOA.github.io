I summerise the normal steps for installing Dynet with Eigen in Ubuntu 16.04.

## Dynet
[DyNet](https://github.com/clab/dynet) (formerly known as [cnn](https://github.com/clab/cnn-v1)) is a neural network library developed by Carnegie Mellon University and many others. It is written in C++ (with bindings in Python) and is designed to be efficient when run on either CPU or GPU.

## Eigen
Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.

Because I need to rebuild [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01913.pdf) which is based on those libraries above, I have to install these C++ libraries and compile all of them in my laptop.

At first, I am not clear which versions of Dynet and Eigen are used in the model. So I tried to install the Dynet 1.0 and Eigen 3.2 according to the creating date of the [Github](https://github.com/jiyfeng/drlm). 

However, I found that I chose a wrong version of Dynet and Eigen. 

1. the [Makefile](https://github.com/jiyfeng/drlm/blob/master/Makefile) shows that the C++ library path is `cnn/build/cnn` not `dynet/build/dynet`. Therefore, I guessed the author used [cnn](https://github.com/clab/cnn-v1) not Dynet.
2. When I compiled Dynet 1.0 with Eigen 3.2, there was a error during compiling. **fatal error: unsupport/Eigen/CXX11/Tensor: No such file or directory**. Then I found solutions from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4680). Others suggested:
> Just check your eigen's version, make sure it is 3.3 or newer. I replaced the 3.2 version with 3.3.4, and fixed this problem. Maybe this can help you too.
3. When the cnn library was compiled with Eigen 3.3, there was another error **there is no easyloggingpp/src in cnn library**. After checking the [Github webpage](https://github.com/clab/cnn-v1/tree/master/external), I need to manually dowenload corresponding [easyloggingpp library](https://github.com/muflihun/easyloggingpp/releases).

To summerise, I succeeded rebuilding the [model](https://github.com/jiyfeng/drlm) with cnn library, Eigen 3.3 and easyloggingpp V9.81.
